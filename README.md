# Game of Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that operates on a grid of cells, evolving over time based on a set of rules. This program provides a simplified implementation of the Game of Life using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.

3. Install the required dependencies (Tkinter is typically included with Python).

4. Run the following command to start the Game of Life program:

   ```shell
   python3 life.py
   ```

5. The program will open a new window displaying the graphical representation of the Game of Life. The cells will evolve and change over time based on the rules of the game.

## Usage

- The program will start with a random grid of cells.
- The GUI window will continuously update to display the evolving state of the cells.
- You can modify the code to customize the initial grid or the rules of the game to suit your preferences.
- The program will continue running until you close the GUI window.

## Customization

- You can modify the constants in the code to change the behavior of the program, such as the size of the grid, cell size, delay between generations, etc.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to add additional features or functionalities to the Game of Life.


## Acknowledgments

The Game of Life was originally created by John Conway in 1970. This program is a simplified implementation inspired by his work.
